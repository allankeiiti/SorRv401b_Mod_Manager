### Streets of Rage Remake V4.01b Mod Manager G.U.I. Project

If you are reading this, you may want to know what this script Does.
As a kid, I always thought those Streets Of Rage Remake V4.01b was a ingame cheat, not a mod
where I had to replace the files.

Personally, I hate to keep a lot of copy of files if I want to play the default game, so I decided
to make a project using my favorite development language Python (I already used Java for study purposes and
I did a project for helpdesk support back in the day) and I started learning programming logic with C, using the
I.D.E. DevC++

This Project was made for study purposes and of course, automate some boring things and creating a G.U.I. for it.
