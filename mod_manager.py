    If you are reading this, you may want to know what this script Does.
    As a kid, I always thought those Streets Of Rage Remake V4.01b was a ingame cheat, not a mod
    where I had to replace the files.

    Personally, I hate to keep a lot of copy of files if I want to play the default game, so I decided
    to make a project using my favorite development language Python (I already used Java for study purposes and
    I did a project for helpdesk support back in the day) and I started learning programming logic with C, using the
    I.D.E. DevC++

    I find out that an user of SORR Community already made a tool using Batch Script as a Mod Manager, I'm happy that
    even with it he encouraged me to make this Python Tool for you guys!

    This Project was made for study purposes and of course, automate some boring things and creating a G.U.I. for it.

    Remember, in Machine Learning we got algorithms for Classify, Regression, Clustering and association rule learning!

# Criar pastas por categoria de mod: Chars jogáveis, inimigos e stages - Talvez no futuro seja implementado para a V5,
# porém como desconheço sua estrutura de arquivos, melhor deixar para o futuro.
# Implementar um .git log na pasta de palletes seria uma boa!
